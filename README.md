# Subway Intervals
Hands-free music interval ear training app for iOS

----
## Introduction
It's a pretty simple app. 

Subway Intervals is a side project I started to play with Apple's new Swift programming language, and to try and learn to better identify musical intervals. It is designed to be used on my commute in to work on the subway (in this case, BART/Muni), using only headphones. It acts as a hands-free flashcard style program, playing an interval, pausing for me to answer in my head, and then speaking the correct answer.

## Current Status
I've just started it, at this point it sort of works, but is still more of a proof of concept stage. Feel free to poke around, but don't expect much at this point.

## Resources
The app uses some of the ["Salamander"](http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/) piano samples.
